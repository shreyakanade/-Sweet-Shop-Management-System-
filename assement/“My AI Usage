🤖 My AI Usage

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools as part of a modern and responsible development workflow.

How AI Was Used

AI tools (such as ChatGPT) were used to:

Generate initial boilerplate code for the backend (Django REST API) and frontend (React components).

Suggest project structure, API endpoint design, and deployment configurations.

Assist with drafting documentation (README), commit messages, and deployment steps.

Provide guidance on debugging deployment issues on platforms like Render and Vercel.

Human Contribution & Validation

All AI-generated code was:

Carefully reviewed, modified, and validated by me.

Extended with custom business logic, validation rules, authentication flows, and role-based access control.

Tested locally and during deployment to ensure correctness, security, and performance.

Final architectural decisions, feature implementations, and UI/UX design choices were made manually.

Transparency & Ethics

AI contributions are transparently acknowledged using:

A dedicated “My AI Usage” section in this README.

Proper Git commit co-author attribution where applicable (e.g., Co-authored-by: AI Tool).

No proprietary or confidential data was shared with AI tools.

Outcome

AI tools were used as a productivity enhancer, not a replacement for core software engineering skills. The final application reflects my understanding of full-stack development, system design, testing, and deployment best practices.
